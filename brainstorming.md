# Mahdi's Idea: 
* Data Collection for a game (e.g. Pokemon, Octopath Traveler COTC, etc.; could be any game in general)
* Drawing app - users are able to draw anything on the app, save the drawings (or see a log of the drawings they've made), and have access to different drawing tools.
* Brick/Pong game (utilizes swipes however to move paddle rather than automatic movement)
